# Nonicons

## This is a fork
This is a fork of the work done by [yamatsum](https://github.com/yamatsum/nonicons).

The goal here is to update the mappings so that the nonicon glyphs do not conflict with the glyph codepoints set by FontAwesome/Nerd-Patched fonts

Nonicons are a set of SVG icons representing programming languages, designing & development tools.

Nonicons are inspired by [Octicons](https://github.com/primer/octicons).
